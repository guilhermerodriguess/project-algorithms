# Algorithms

Welcome to the Algorithms project repository!

The Algorithms project aims to develop problem-solving skills and optimize algorithms by implementing solutions to various everyday problems.

## Skills Practiced

The project exercises the following skills:

- Logic
- Problem interpretation
- Interpretation of legacy code
- Problem-solving and algorithm optimization under pressure

## Mandatory Requirements

1. Study Schedule - Number of Students Studying at the Same Time (Search Algorithm)
2. Encryption of Inversions (Testing)
3. Palindromes (Recursion)
4. Anagrams (Sorting Algorithm)

## Bonus Requirements

5. Finding Duplicates (Search Algorithm)
6. Palindromes (Iterative Solution)
